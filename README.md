# Hello-word
my first repository on Github

My Chinese name is Meng Yuan, you can also call me Damon.
I've learned C/C++ language for my internship,  I learned the basical rules about the two languages but I rarely practicing them, so I'm not good at programing by C/C++ now. What a shame!

I've written some Matlab codes while I was a postgraduate, I think Matlab is very intresting and easyly to learning. It supplies so many tool-box for kinds of different fields, almost everyone can do something by MATLAB, although it may not perform very effectively while execute some complex projects.  My first GUI was written by MATLAB, I was just curious about GUI, because it looks like very intresting so I wanna know how it works and how to write a GUI from the beginning. I studied some tutorials and worked it out after a whole day trial, my first MATLAB GUI is a calculator!

I met Python by coincidence. It seems a advertisement title said "write a simple game by Python" or "spider musics online by Python" which draw my attention. I've learned some tutorials online, and tried some simple spiders. I'm still learning about spdiers now.

That's all, so this is my first repository on GitHub.
